@FordThunderman @slayadidanca @CapiLady @nypostbiz Thanks for sharing. That was a great clip. @TiffanyDCross rightly called out TS for saying America is not racist. Progress has been made for sure but don’t get it twisted. A majority of white folks did not vote for Obama in either election. 43 &amp; 37% of white votes is all he got
"@michael_rich29 @GbengaGOLD @PeterObi Are u even making sense at all, damn, this ppl ehn, Na God fit help una, even with fact of progress una go still say something, vote your candidate ooo, no sit down for house during the election time bcos we no wan hear say dem do una ojoro oo lol 😆 🤣 😉"
"@CharmedbyKaren @GabrielSterling I believe any effort to further restrict access to voting is suppression. Kemp is quoted on record that he did not like the results of the 2020 election in GA and that more ""minorities"" were voting. When 2+2 =4 there's no need to pretend there was another reason 4 new voting laws"
@Truth_Tornado @CNN @jaketapper Again…you are believing a lie because it fits a narrative which you already accept. There were no lines anywhere in GA on Election Day in 2020. The law on water is no 3rd party can enter the 150 ft area near polling to do it. You are being lied to for political reasons.

It’s the damn and scary as hell. I hope many more than 2020 turn out and vote! This midterm election is more important than the Presidential election. I just hope Americans realize that. If Republicans win life as we know it will be forever changed!"
"@andymeyers10 @GabrielSterling It did seem slower per person this year.

The ID requirement has indeed been in place for a long time.

I voted first week, so I can only assume either the new voting systems are slower or they were still learning them.

This is the first big election with the new hardware."
@GabrielSterling @stphnfwlr Reminder folks voting Election Day: read your sample ballot online all the way to the end b4 you go/write all choices on a piece of paper. Waiting time in lines can move quicker if voters don’t have to read it all for the 1st time incl the special bills/resolutions etc at the end
"@johnj17 @CMetrakas @brithume Not following your logic. Trump started election-denying all the way back to Iowa in ‘16 when he lost to Cruz. He said it was rigged back.

"This election I have had hundreds of dollars in signs being stolen across the district. So this time I’m putting it on video so y’all know the signs did exist. At the end of the day though, signs don’t vote— people do!

"@JradRabel Absolutely right!! I also don’t like this early voting stuff.

"@markniesse @bluestein Since 2020 saw a huge increase in VBM that we have not seen in 2022 (partly because SB 202 made it harder to vote that way), I think we will see similar numbers on Election Day to what we saw in 2018. That’s my prediction. I don’t see any indication that wouldn’t happen."

"I don't understand why more ppl don't take advantage of early voting in GA. You have 3 weeks, including Sat &amp; Sun in some locations, to get your ballot in. I went the first day and it took me around 7 mins to be in and out.  That's better than 6 hrs on election day."
"@Evelyn31721 @authenticreel @stphnfwlr @Forbes Cases can take time to get through courts. That's true.

But there would be public records if they had done any filing of an actual case. Anyone can talk about fraud, but until there are court cases it's just talk and this close to an election it's just playing dirty politics."
"Wow HD 108!! We’ve already hit the 10K votes mark which represents about 25% of registered voters in the district. But that means there are still 30K votes out there, with less than a week to go!

"@KeyserSozeBro1 It was that way almost everywhere, at least here in the Atlanta area. Now that GA has had several cycles with EV, election day tends to function as the final day of early voting, rather than a big event in itself. But who knows? 🤷‍♂️ We'll just have to wait and see this year."

And, for this election, we counted them ALL 3 times, 3 different ways. tl;dr - the idea that someone could slap some extras on a scanner during the count and it wouldn’t stand out like a blaring siren is, in a word, laughable. /x"
@iMajorWish @stphnfwlr @KasimReed @andreforatlanta @CityofAtlanta Yeah. UPDATE 💔 I talked to WSB. They misreported based on an increase of Fulton voters for Reed @ 100% reporting but excluded Dekalb. Too many of the tiny # of voters this election have no/low sense of danger &amp; coming calamity. WE NEED KASIM. God help us. #BuckheadCity #atlpol https://t.co/0QaadRNTK3
@triciaharris @hmichaelharvey And as far as “smoke” - why would “smoke” come my way for standing up for the people after the people spoke via the polls last night. Our issues are bigger than one candidate and one election. We are always open to partner to fix the problems. But “💨” is of no concern. If I am
So Donald Trump is a dumb dumb. How can the capital city Terrorist be “very special” but also be Antifa. If you ask him right now he will say “Mike Pence didn’t do the right thing.” He couldn’t overturn the free and fare election. If the VP had that power no one would ever lose.
"@RErwinSpencer @GaSecofState @SpeakerRalston @GovKemp Actually that isn’t correct. The law remains that a voter 65+ or with a disability can request an absentee in the first election in the cycle, check a box to receive the absentee ballots for the remaining elections of that cycle, just like under law last cycle and cycles before."
"@TRay_198 Let me explain something, as the wife of a postal worker. While 1st class mail is being slowed down, official election mail such as ballots have never been and are still not treated the same way - it ALWAYS is of the highest priority in the system and gets where it needs to go."
"@itsgreek2me2 @MorgaineSwann @donaldj22717589 @MichelleRSmith @SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff Agreed-but first, we HAVE get John Lewis Voting Rights N2 law! Those of us living in now-infamous Fulton County, GA (or really anywhere in GA) are living under the spectre of actual state law that allows the Rep. legislature to change the outcome of any election to their liking!"
"Is this suppose to make up for all the community clean ups he missed that I attended in Grove Park, Center Hill, Carey Park, &amp; Collier Heights? Folks should be offended by this. Hillis let trash sit on our streets for most of the year &amp; then before the election gets to work 🙄 https://t.co/zunkQJwmro"
@Rebecca4Georgia @RepDonnaMcLeod @JoshforGeorgia @sheaforgeorgia @MooreForGeorgia While their voices are needed in this fight and it is infuriating to see that the demand has to be made in light of the role Georgia played in the 2020 election? All of these lawmakers have constituents who will need their help with this eviction crisis. I hope they multitask.
"@AmosFromWV @all_outta_gum @MythSerene @MichelleUgenti As for the ‘20 election, people like you declare that Biden could not have gotten as many votes as he did. Thus fraud occurred. 

Fact: plain and simple: more people HATED Trump than loved him. 

In AZ 10’s of 1000’s of ballots voted straight GOP except for prez. Thus Trump lost."
"@Spartacousin @ohitswaters @2020GTOY @JoshuaHol Oh, this is rich! We just had an election where we elected TWO Senators but we lost a state seat for the Public Service Commission that impacts Georgians just as much because Democrsts were rolling in all that marquee race money and FORGOT. 

And them there's how we got MTG."
"@kidlargo @SlothRedux @JacobPhillip801 @Elections_Daily @SenateDems @ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz @SenatorSinema @Sen_JoeManchin @amyklobuchar It was wrong to try to delegitimize Trump’s win as *some* people did, but Russia did interfere in the 2016 election and, per the Mueller Report, Trump campaign was well aware of the interference during the election and welcomed it, even though they didn’t directly collude."
"@AmyP5280 @AdamsEwot @GaSecofState We live in a two party nation. That is a consequence of our fir across the line election system. I will fight to save my party rather than abandon it. In the long run, it’s the vehicle to defend individual Liberty. I know you won’t agree. And MTG, Hice &amp; Gaetz are nutty."
@AGrl21 @Alfreds86347959 @MrsKathyC @jadapsmith I don’t need stats. There’s videos of kops frightened of a man with a sandwiches &amp; cell phones. Kops frightened of men driving away from them. President trump has proof that the election was stolen so stats don’t mean shit.People are dead because kops don’t no a taser from a gun.
Good morning. Here is where we are. I thought the Fox News Justices might be well to the right of the median voter and provoke a crisis like 1936. Now I worry that the GOP is well to the right of the median voter but will take power anyway through election fraud and force. Sigh.
@pollyannathibo1 @ChrisCarr_Ga The Secretary still certifies the election. That is unchanged in this law. Some counties have and do Vail their voters and need to have accountability. If no law had passed all drop boxes in the state would have to have been removed so w/o the law the number of Dropboxes is zero.
"@WLHEARNS @kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid @GovKemp Well, that also isn’t true. There were no lines on Election Day in November or January. The law actually mandates that any polling location w/ 2k or more voters and there is a line of 1 hour or more at any point of the day, it has to split the locations voters or add equipment."
"@mjrobertson1961 @outfoxed_toni @bluestein @CocaCola @MLB It took away drop boxes, it shortened voting to 5pm, it decreases voting locations in Atlanta, it says you can only have early voting Saturday OR sunday not both. It takes away the SOS oversight and lets the republicans choose any crooked person they want to oversee the election"
"@WillDad @politicalinsidr @DougRobersonAJC @ajc @dwickert Having the run off 4 weeks after the general. Since it takes 2-3 weeks to certify the election and absentees can’t be ordered after 11 days before the election, there will be few to no absentees. Early voting will be at most a few days. This is a massive restriction."
"@UnimpressedTX @TNConserv13 @danjasper @StaffSergeant18 @guypbenson @McCormackJohn @storm_paglia ‘It’s now illegal for election officials to mail out absentee ballot applications to all voters.’ 
This has never been a thing in GA. You’ve always had to request an absentee ballot. Under the governors Covid emergency plan last year, they sent out mail in ballots to everybody."
"Gabriel Sterling or Marc Elias? 🤔 I'll bet my last dollar on Marc any day. Sterling was key for 2020 election, but he has proven himself to be a liar. He denied 5 hr waits in GA in the last election knowing that was BS. I consider him bought and paid for by the GOPQ. https://t.co/nv6H2EL3JI"
"@Phil_Davis_ @kristibjork @Delta I was telling the truth after the November election. I’m telling the truth now. This isn’t the law I would have written in some ways, but it isn’t voter suppression. Saying it is doesn’t make it so. It is much easier to vote in Georgia than in most of the country."
"@ArkieGrower @DGray_2019 @McRouvi These 3 issues in particular arose as a result of the runoff election in JAN which DEMs Warnock &amp; Ossoff won, shocking the GOP (idiots!) Since more DEMs voted than usual, traitor GOP are grasping at any &amp; all ways 2 suppress DEM votes 2 grab power. They’ve poked a sleeping lion🔥"
"@MrBobbyHill3 @NichollsLorelei @mattdizwhitlock @FoxNewsSunday @HolmesJosh Yep. 1st, it only applies to the next election. Does zip for one in progress.  Places that are hardest hit are not always the same. Usu associated with reassigning/redrawing precincts and allocation of equip. And the new law puts 100% of the $ burden for that on the counties. /1"
"@aydreahna @BrianKempGA I guess the thought by MLBPA is that MLB fans in GA will feel alienated by their reps for forcing their hand instead of blaming their favorite players &amp; in turn show up in the next election

But it sounds a lot like trickle down economics to me: BS in application &amp; everyone loses"
"You must be bi-polar during the election you fought to express how our election was fair and legal, now this bill you rushed to sign in law you said to do the same thing, which one is true? Was it fair then or now? True Liars never know how to tell the Truth, you are True! https://t.co/CVscQSDcpH"
"@JamesWilson0904 @BartBuff All that is true. To me, even more so, is just the bad optics. Looks like Bull Connor tactics when she is legally allowed to go in there. Let her in. She disrupts the event, then you plenty of election footage fodder. Either they are really stupid or so desperate to hold power."
"@noparty4523 @DonaldJTrumpJr No the election was stolen from Trump and if you can see how much he's slipped out of His mind, Nancy the creep keeper is calling the abita, what did go say in his last brifing he said I'll do whatever you want me to Nanc. Lol dont talk crazy we choose Trump and yall stole it."
"@Govshina @bukolasaraki @OfficialPDPNig Shina , You are aware that Principal Bukola reports to Alhaji ... We only pray that Alhaji doesn’t contest but to win the presidential election in Nigeria I repeat you need a Fulani man as President or VP on that ticket .. It’s no one fault but the fore fathers faults"
