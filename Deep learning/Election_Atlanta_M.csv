1,not negative,@FordThunderman @slayadidanca @CapiLady @nypostbiz Thanks for sharing. That was a great clip. @TiffanyDCross rightly called out TS for saying America is not racist. Progress has been made for sure but donâ€™t get it twisted. A majority of white folks did not vote for Obama in either election. 43 &amp; 37% of white votes is all he got
2,negative,"@michael_rich29 @GbengaGOLD @PeterObi Are u even making sense at all, damn, this ppl ehn, Na God fit help una, even with fact of progress una go still say something, vote your candidate ooo, no sit down for house during the election time bcos we no wan hear say dem do una ojoro oo lol _Ÿ˜† _Ÿ_£ _Ÿ˜‰"
3,negative,"@CharmedbyKaren @GabrielSterling I believe any effort to further restrict access to voting is suppression. Kemp is quoted on record that he did not like the results of the 2020 election in GA and that more ""minorities"" were voting. When 2+2 =4 there's no need to pretend there was another reason 4 new voting laws"
4,negative,@Truth_Tornado @CNN @jaketapper Againâ€_you are believing a lie because it fits a narrative which you already accept. There were no lines anywhere in GA on Election Day in 2020. The law on water is no 3rd party can enter the 150 ft area near polling to do it. You are being lied to for political reasons.

Itâ€™s the damn and scary as hell. I hope many more than 2020 turn out and vote! This midterm election is more important than the Presidential election. I just hope Americans realize that. If Republicans win life as we know it will be forever changed!"
6,not negative,"@andymeyers10 @GabrielSterling It did seem slower per person this year.

The ID requirement has indeed been in place for a long time.

I voted first week, so I can only assume either the new voting systems are slower or they were still learning them.

This is the first big election with the new hardware."
7,not negative,@GabrielSterling @stphnfwlr Reminder folks voting Election Day: read your sample ballot online all the way to the end b4 you go/write all choices on a piece of paper. Waiting time in lines can move quicker if voters donâ€™t have to read it all for the 1st time incl the special bills/resolutions etc at the end
8,negative,"@johnj17 @CMetrakas @brithume Not following your logic. Trump started election-denying all the way back to Iowa in â€˜16 when he lost to Cruz. He said it was rigged back. Hell, heâ€™s even on record as saying back in â€˜12 that Romney lost because it was rigged. The man does not accept the will of the people."
9,negative,"This election I have had hundreds of dollars in signs being stolen across the district. So this time Iâ€™m putting it on video so yâ€™all know the signs did exist. At the end of the day though, signs donâ€™t voteâ€” people do!

13,negative,We know MAGA GOP is controlled by a corrupt dictator whose platform is based on lies. It is a Proven Fact Trump did not win 2020 Election. MAGA GOP supports election deniers. GOPâ€™s brand use 2b Moral Values. Have U sold your soul? Or can U speak up &amp; say MAGA GOP Enough is Enough
14,not negative,"This tweet was unintentionally a Rorschach test.  Didn't mean it to be that way.  Oz can still win.  The polling trends have favored him.

16,negative,"@JradRabel Absolutely right!! I also donâ€™t like this early voting stuff. When I was growing up you voted on election day or, if you were in the military/legitimately out of state, then you used the mail in ballot. Like you, I have little faith in the election system! I am voting in person! https://t.co/4sLArB56Ey"
17,negative,@Billflanigan @GabrielSterling I am OK with the world &amp; more importantly the white progressive libs seeing who he really isâ€_They hv elevated him to such heights for merely doing his job when HIS life was threatened that itâ€™s only normal that the real cretin that he is comes out so close to Election Day.
18,negative,"MAGA Election Denierâ€™s Goal is 2 have A â€œOne Party Ruleâ€ù (GOP) Where our Vote will no longer Count. If they win they will Deny our Vote 2 Win. What they R doing is based on a Lie. Mama said, If U Lie U Will Steal. VOTE While We Still Have Our Democracy, Instead of Dictatorship."
19,not negative,"@merm67 You do understand that lots of people WORK 12+ hour shifts and can't get to an election office between 9 am and 5 pm M- F, right?

21,negative,@Derwin0000 @staceyabrams @ReverendWarnock @senatorjen @BeeForGeorgia Not the same. She just questioned Kemp overseeing his own election as SOS. I didnâ€™t see her bitching about illegitimate votes or attacking poll workers. Like I said Iâ€™m an independent. If you think that was even remotely similar to Trump then thereâ€™s not much we can agree on
22,not negative,"@markniesse @bluestein Since 2020 saw a huge increase in VBM that we have not seen in 2022 (partly because SB 202 made it harder to vote that way), I think we will see similar numbers on Election Day to what we saw in 2018. Thatâ€™s my prediction. I donâ€™t see any indication that wouldnâ€™t happen."
23,not negative,"@ChaseGooch @Clear404Sky @Reuters Libs have denied election results in every presidential election they lost since Bush 1. Clinton is already out making claims about 2024.

26,negative,@petespiliakos If itâ€™s DeSantis v Biden in 24 then Rs could conceivably win 8+ senate seats and I think Democrats know that. I also think heâ€™s genuinely too old and Ds know that too. I predict we get a long Times or WaPo article right after the election about how bad his decline actually is.
27,not negative,"I don't understand why more ppl don't take advantage of early voting in GA. You have 3 weeks, including Sat &amp; Sun in some locations, to get your ballot in. I went the first day and it took me around 7 mins to be in and out.  That's better than 6 hrs on election day."
28,negative,"@Evelyn31721 @authenticreel @stphnfwlr @Forbes Cases can take time to get through courts. That's true.

But there would be public records if they had done any filing of an actual case. Anyone can talk about fraud, but until there are court cases it's just talk and this close to an election it's just playing dirty politics."
29,not negative,"Wow HD 108!! Weâ€™ve already hit the 10K votes mark which represents about 25% of registered voters in the district. But that means there are still 30K votes out there, with less than a week to go!

30,not negative,"@WendyHail2024 @thecjpearson The early voting process was the same as Election Day.  A poll worker checks me in and takes my ID to scan.  Asks me to verify my info and then gives me a card to take to the voting booth.  I then insert the card and make my selections.  Review, print, review again and scan into"
31,not negative,"@KeyserSozeBro1 It was that way almost everywhere, at least here in the Atlanta area. Now that GA has had several cycles with EV, election day tends to function as the final day of early voting, rather than a big event in itself. But who knows? _Ÿ_·â€çâ™‚ï¸è We'll just have to wait and see this year."

34,not negative,@WestonGardner @EWErickson @stphnfwlr Dems need to be way ahead in the early voting to absorb the large GOP showing (compared to the Demsâ€™ showing) on Election Day.

83,negative,"@CawthornforNC It's almost like you want him to fail. Let me give you a little tip...when he fails we fail. But you would have learned that about the last guy had you not been trying to overturn an election that he lost. As for you, being successful would actually require you to do something."
84,negative,"@tiwaworks1 @DrDukeDDS at all of them it was the same 'you must be this funded to ride' BS

a common complaint among even just those of the 14 on ballot candidates is that news coverage, public forums &amp; the such basically made-out asif there was only the same 5 people in this election every event/story"
85,negative,"@WalshFreedom This is a bad take. It wasnâ€™t about the election, it was about holding on to power. A sitting President attempted to stay in power, everything else is a result of that goal. Had he thrown the same fit in 2016 it would not be in the same universe as the damage done as POTUS."
86,negative,"@FakeDanWeber @jakehsnider @deidremenged0ht And, in case you forgot from when you linked a few minutes ago, hereâ€™s you talking about â€œwhipping membersâ€ù in THIS thread in regard to the WV election, which sent you off scrambling trying to blame it on a different thread when I called you on it. Youâ€™re a lying waste of time."
87,not negative,"@IamKingWilliams @Representable_ Why IS there a such a strong push by the state to use these electronic voting machines when no one really knows how they work and count the votes? I realize this doesn't play well into the 2020 narrative of a 'safe, secure election' due to Biden winning the state, but we..."
88,not negative,"@notmollyallison Yeesh thats awful. Wasnt tryna be a dick! Being in GA I got several a day during the pres election and senate run off. Trying to opt out worked sometimes, other times I was retargeted or there were lots of follow up qâ€™s. Just tryna really get off the list cause Im gettin blown up"
89,not negative,"@marceelias Yes, all the way. And if yâ€™all are looking for help in GA, I havenâ€™t practiced election law but Iâ€™ve worked Voter Protection here for over a decade and have a good handle on state law, and Iâ€™ve been around both the courtroom and mass data cases. Anything to help push the rock."
90,not negative,"@staciewrites @AdamsEwot @RErwinSpencer @bankomcfly2 @GaSecofState @VoteBradRaff @BeeForGeorgia That isnâ€™t correct. Under the old and new law, those over 65 or w/ a disability could make a single request and get a ballot for each election in that cycle. That was not changed at all. If you are outside of that criteria, you have to do the same no excuse request."
91,negative,"@VamonosSquirrel @Wikweko @realLizUSA And the tallied votes are segregated by precinct. And, for this election, we counted them ALL 3 times, 3 different ways. tl;dr - the idea that someone could slap some extras on a scanner during the count and it wouldnâ€™t stand out like a blaring siren is, in a word, laughable. /x"
92,negative,@iMajorWish @stphnfwlr @KasimReed @andreforatlanta @CityofAtlanta Yeah. UPDATE _Ÿ’” I talked to WSB. They misreported based on an increase of Fulton voters for Reed @ 100% reporting but excluded Dekalb. Too many of the tiny # of voters this election have no/low sense of danger &amp; coming calamity. WE NEED KASIM. God help us. #BuckheadCity #atlpol https://t.co/0QaadRNTK3
93,not negative,@triciaharris @hmichaelharvey And as far as â€œsmokeâ€ù - why would â€œsmokeâ€ù come my way for standing up for the people after the people spoke via the polls last night. Our issues are bigger than one candidate and one election. We are always open to partner to fix the problems. But â€œ_Ÿ’¨â€ù is of no concern. If I am
94,negative,So Donald Trump is a dumb dumb. How can the capital city Terrorist be â€œvery specialâ€ù but also be Antifa. If you ask him right now he will say â€œMike Pence didnâ€™t do the right thing.â€ù He couldnâ€™t overturn the free and fare election. If the VP had that power no one would ever lose.
95,not negative,"@RErwinSpencer @GaSecofState @SpeakerRalston @GovKemp Actually that isnâ€™t correct. The law remains that a voter 65+ or with a disability can request an absentee in the first election in the cycle, check a box to receive the absentee ballots for the remaining elections of that cycle, just like under law last cycle and cycles before."
96,not negative,"@TRay_198 Let me explain something, as the wife of a postal worker. While 1st class mail is being slowed down, official election mail such as ballots have never been and are still not treated the same way - it ALWAYS is of the highest priority in the system and gets where it needs to go."
97,negative,"@itsgreek2me2 @MorgaineSwann @donaldj22717589 @MichelleRSmith @SpeakerPelosi @RepAdamSchiff Agreed-but first, we HAVE get John Lewis Voting Rights N2 law! Those of us living in now-infamous Fulton County, GA (or really anywhere in GA) are living under the spectre of actual state law that allows the Rep. legislature to change the outcome of any election to their liking!"

99,negative,@Rebecca4Georgia @RepDonnaMcLeod @JoshforGeorgia @sheaforgeorgia @MooreForGeorgia While their voices are needed in this fight and it is infuriating to see that the demand has to be made in light of the role Georgia played in the 2020 election? All of these lawmakers have constituents who will need their help with this eviction crisis. I hope they multitask.
100,negative,"@AmosFromWV @all_outta_gum @MythSerene @MichelleUgenti As for the â€˜20 election, people like you declare that Biden could not have gotten as many votes as he did. Thus fraud occurred. 

Fact: plain and simple: more people HATED Trump than loved him. 

In AZ 10â€™s of 1000â€™s of ballots voted straight GOP except for prez. Thus Trump lost."
101,negative,"@Spartacousin @ohitswaters @2020GTOY @JoshuaHol Oh, this is rich! We just had an election where we elected TWO Senators but we lost a state seat for the Public Service Commission that impacts Georgians just as much because Democrsts were rolling in all that marquee race money and FORGOT. 

And them there's how we got MTG."
102,negative,"@kidlargo @SlothRedux @JacobPhillip801 @Elections_Daily @SenateDems @ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz @SenatorSinema @Sen_JoeManchin @amyklobuchar It was wrong to try to delegitimize Trumpâ€™s win as *some* people did, but Russia did interfere in the 2016 election and, per the Mueller Report, Trump campaign was well aware of the interference during the election and welcomed it, even though they didnâ€™t directly collude."
103,not negative,"@AmyP5280 @AdamsEwot @GaSecofState We live in a two party nation. That is a consequence of our fir across the line election system. I will fight to save my party rather than abandon it. In the long run, itâ€™s the vehicle to defend individual Liberty. I know you wonâ€™t agree. And MTG, Hice &amp; Gaetz are nutty."
104,negative,@AGrl21 @Alfreds86347959 @MrsKathyC @jadapsmith I donâ€™t need stats. Thereâ€™s videos of kops frightened of a man with a sandwiches &amp; cell phones. Kops frightened of men driving away from them. President trump has proof that the election was stolen so stats donâ€™t mean shit.People are dead because kops donâ€™t no a taser from a gun.
105,negative,Good morning. Here is where we are. I thought the Fox News Justices might be well to the right of the median voter and provoke a crisis like 1936. Now I worry that the GOP is well to the right of the median voter but will take power anyway through election fraud and force. Sigh.
106,not negative,@pollyannathibo1 @ChrisCarr_Ga The Secretary still certifies the election. That is unchanged in this law. Some counties have and do Vail their voters and need to have accountability. If no law had passed all drop boxes in the state would have to have been removed so w/o the law the number of Dropboxes is zero.
107,not negative,"@WLHEARNS @kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid @GovKemp Well, that also isnâ€™t true. There were no lines on Election Day in November or January. The law actually mandates that any polling location w/ 2k or more voters and there is a line of 1 hour or more at any point of the day, it has to split the locations voters or add equipment."
108,negative,"@mjrobertson1961 @outfoxed_toni @bluestein @CocaCola @MLB It took away drop boxes, it shortened voting to 5pm, it decreases voting locations in Atlanta, it says you can only have early voting Saturday OR sunday not both. It takes away the SOS oversight and lets the republicans choose any crooked person they want to oversee the election"
109,negative,"@WillDad @politicalinsidr @DougRobersonAJC @ajc @dwickert Having the run off 4 weeks after the general. Since it takes 2-3 weeks to certify the election and absentees canâ€™t be ordered after 11 days before the election, there will be few to no absentees. Early voting will be at most a few days. This is a massive restriction."

This has never been a thing in GA. Youâ€™ve always had to request an absentee ballot. Under the governors Covid emergency plan last year, they sent out mail in ballots to everybody."
111,negative,"Gabriel Sterling or Marc Elias? _Ÿ_” I'll bet my last dollar on Marc any day. Sterling was key for 2020 election, but he has proven himself to be a liar. He denied 5 hr waits in GA in the last election knowing that was BS. I consider him bought and paid for by the GOPQ. https://t.co/nv6H2EL3JI"
112,not negative,"@Phil_Davis_ @kristibjork @Delta I was telling the truth after the November election. Iâ€™m telling the truth now. This isnâ€™t the law I would have written in some ways, but it isnâ€™t voter suppression. Saying it is doesnâ€™t make it so. It is much easier to vote in Georgia than in most of the country."

Places that are hardest hit are not always the same. Usu associated with reassigning/redrawing precincts and allocation of equip. And the new law puts 100% of the $ burden for that on the counties. /1"
115,negative,"@aydreahna @BrianKempGA I guess the thought by MLBPA is that MLB fans in GA will feel alienated by their reps for forcing their hand instead of blaming their favorite players &amp; in turn show up in the next election

But it sounds a lot like trickle down economics to me: BS in application &amp; everyone loses"
116,negative,"You must be bi-polar during the election you fought to express how our election was fair and legal, now this bill you rushed to sign in law you said to do the same thing, which one is true?
